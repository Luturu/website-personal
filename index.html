<h2>Monday</h2>
<P><font face="bahnschrift,helvetica",size=6, color=Navy Blue>There is nothing much I do on that day. it was a boring day and I was bored. I just lay down on my bed or go to living room because on afternoon my bedroom is so hot and living room is the only place that is cold and I always go there.I just spend time on that day just lazying around and do nothing just like a bear.</P>


<h2>Tuesday</h2>
<P><font face="bahnschrift,helvetica",size=6, color=Navy Blue>On Tuesday I started to do my assignment because it was so boring at home and I dont have any friend at home there is only grandpa and my grandma. I only talk to them when there is something is going on. I also talk to them when we have a tea time on evening. Grandma always call my name to have a tea time on evening.</P>

<h2>Wednesday</h2>
<P><font face="bahnschrift,helvetica",size=6, color=Navy Blue>There is nothing much going on this day. I always spend my leisure time with playing games on my mobile phone and playing laptop. I got too bored and decided to clean my room. After the cleaning session I continue to playing games on my mobile phone like usual.</P>

<h2>Thursday</h2>
<P><font face="bahnschrift,helvetica",size=6, color=Navy Blue>I prepare for my individual assingment and present for my video presentation. This video presentation is for subject IMD313. The lecturer for this subject is Miss Suhaida Halamy. She choose the presenter for this subject randomly every week. So i got to be the second presenter on that day. It is very difficult to submit this video presentation to Miss after I have done my presentation because the video file is too big and I have a limited data. So I decided to submit it tommorow and already explain it to Miss and she allowed it.</P>
    
<h2>Friday</h2>
<P><font face="bahnschrift,helvetica",size=6, color=Navy Blue>I submit the assignment and luckily the assignment has successfully been submitted to Miss Dida. After submit the assignment I do my usual activity which is playing games and surfing internet using my laptop. After do that I go to living room and sleep there because I always sleep late in the night. I usually sleep between 1am to 3am because Im so bored.</P>

<h2>Saturday</h2>
<P><font face="bahnschrift,helvetica",size=6, color=Navy Blue>On Saturday my grandparents have their quite time and pray together at home because they are SDA(Seven-day Adventeist). They have their praying session on Saturday not like other Christian which on Sunday. I join them because it will be disrespectful if I dont join them to pray together in their home. After that we eat together and enjoy chit-chatting. Grandma always share her experiences in other countries like Indonesia and Korea. I enjoy it when my grandma shre their stories. My grandpa doesn't like to talk much. He just like to watch television and do his work.</P>

<h2>Sunday</h2>
<P><font face="bahnschrift,helvetica",size=6, color=Navy Blue>I just do my own work and just in my own bedroom. Sometimes I go to my cousin's home to gossiping with them. They always share their stories to me. I just listen and respond to them with laugh and I share my stories with them too but they mostly conquer the conversation. I just listening.</P>
